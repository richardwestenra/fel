# Installation:

Point Chrome to chrome://extensions/, tick the Developer mode checkbox at the top-left of that window, then click the Load unpacked extension button. Point Chrome to this folder, click Select or OK (varies by operating system), Chrome will load up your stub of an extension, and you should see your little Yeoman icon appear in the right of your Chrome URL omnibar on page refresh.

The extension only works at eventbrite.com/.co.uk, though it shows all the time so you can change settings whenever you like. Settings are stored locally so they won't carry across devices. Once you change a setting, you'll need to refresh the page for it to take effect. Note that once it's bought a ticket, it'll keep refreshing, so you should probably turn that setting off once you've got one.
