# Okay here's what you need to know

## If you want to work on it:

Clone the repo  and run `npm install && bower install`. Point Chrome to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), tick the Developer mode checkbox at the top-left of that window, then click the Load unpacked extension button. Point Chrome to this folder, click Select or OK (varies by operating system), Chrome will load up the extension, and you should see a little Yeoman icon appear in the right of your Chrome URL omnibar on page refresh.

## If you just want to use it:

Point Chrome to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and drag the `fel.crx` file onto the page. Chrome will load up the extension, and you should see a little Yeoman icon appear in the right of your Chrome URL omnibar on page refresh.

## Usage:

The extension only works at [eventbrite.[com|co.uk]](http://eventbrite.co.uk/), though it shows all the time so you can change settings whenever you like. Settings are stored locally so they won't carry across devices. Once you change a setting, you'll need to refresh the page for it to take effect. Note that once it's bought a ticket, it'll keep refreshing, so you should probably turn that setting off once you've got one.
